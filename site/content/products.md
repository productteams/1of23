        We believe that wildcrafted artifacts have the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow foragers/makers/artisans and learn about
        maker techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

    quote: >-
      The first time I saw 1of23's products I was astounded by the creativity of their makers, I couldn’t even believe that 
      I could actually know the forest owner of the floor I installed in my home, and visit the exact location of the lush forest that nourished my floor for years. I love the transparency and I know that my new floors were indeed harvested sustainably
